# Trading-With-Momentum

In this project, I learned to implement a trading strategy on my own, and test to see if it has the potential to be profitable. I was supplied with a universe of stocks and the time range. I was also provided with a textual description of how to generate a trading signal based on a momentum indicator. I then computed the signal for the time range given and applied it to the dataset to produce projected returns. Finally, I performed a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, I used the end of day from Quotemedia.# FinTech-Trading-Momentum
